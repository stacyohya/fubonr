(CNN)More than 200 people are dead and 1,700 injured after a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck the border region between Iran and Iraq.

Iran's Press TV says the highest number of casualties in the country occurred in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, Kermanshah province.
Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency said 100 of the 207 reported dead were from that town alone.
While most of the deaths have been reported in Iran, the quake's epicenter was across the border in Iraq, about 350 kilometers (217 miles) north of Baghdad.
Tremors were felt throughout the country, according the US Geological Survey, which said the quake reached a depth of 23km, or just over 14 miles.
The quake crushed buildings in Darbandikhan, in northern Iraq, according to video from AFP. Dozens of people from the town were wounded, according to Omar Ahmad, the governor of Sulaimaniya province. In nearby Halabja, at least four people were reported dead.
